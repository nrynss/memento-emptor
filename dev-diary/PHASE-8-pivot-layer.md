# P8: The layer, after the pivot

Recall that never refuses, corrections that stand on their own, the fit index written at ingest, the pool read back, and one Lambo process serving every shopper. Everything in P9 and P10 demonstrates this.

Read first: [`../product.md`](../product.md), [`PHASE-7-pivot-contracts.md`](PHASE-7-pivot-contracts.md), `research/lambo-multi.md`, `research/elastic-fit.md`, and the P2 tasks whose packages you change.

---

### T8.1: One Lambo process for every shopper
```yaml
requires:   [T0.11, T7.2]
fixture-ok: yes
size:       S · mid
owns:       deploy/start.sh, deploy/README.md
status:     claimed:t81-hub
```
Move the deploy from one writer for one session (`LAMBO_SESSION`) to the shape T0.11 recommends: one `lambo serve --transport http`, a credential with `session_prefix = "shopper-"` and `create = true`, `max_attached` 16, and sessions named by T7.2. `serve-web` starts with the demo shoppers as its allowlist, until [Lambo issue 241](https://github.com/nrynss/lambo/issues/241) lands. The layer addresses each shopper at `/mcp/s/<session>`.

**Done when:** `start.sh` brings up the hub locally and a test drives two shoppers through it with no cross-read. `deploy/README.md` says how a shopper session is created and how the ledger reader's allowlist is set. The gate passes.

### T8.1b: The Lambo hub, live
```yaml
requires:   [T8.1]
fixture-ok: no
size:       XS · mid
owns:       tests/live/hub/
status:     not-started
```
The T8.1 shape against the live Elastic recall tier: three shoppers created on demand, each recalls only its own concepts, and the ledger reader serves the allowlisted ones. Budget: under $0.20 of embedding spend. Run one shopper first and check its cost. Test sessions are erased afterwards.

**Done when:** the transcript is in the handoff log, with spend and the erase shown.

---

### T8.2: The fit index writer ★
```yaml
requires:   [T7.1, T7.2]
fixture-ok: yes
size:       M · mid
owns:       internal/fitindex/, internal/ingest/
status:     claimed:t82-fit-writer
```
Ingest writes a fit row beside every Lambo write, from the same event: capture creates the row, a refund marks it returned, a classified reason gives it a category and direction, fit feedback and kept-past-the-window settle it, and a contested reason updates it. Each write replaces the whole document at the state-rank version with `external_gte` (T0.12: the partial `_update` API refuses external versioning). The index is created from T7.1's mapping. Only the layer's interface to the index is named in domain code (developer rule 6).

**Done when:** a fixture test drives one purchase through every state, in order and shuffled, and ends at the same row. A replayed webhook is harmless, and an older state never overwrites a newer one. A refund with no reason is stored but not settled. A shopper's correction writes nothing to the index. An opted-out shopper's events write no row, and opting out deletes their existing rows across every line their session knows, while leaving other shoppers' rows alone. The gate passes.

### T8.2b: The fit index writer, live
```yaml
requires:   [T8.2]
fixture-ok: no
size:       XS · mid
owns:       tests/live/fitindex/
status:     not-started
```
One sandbox purchase through capture, refund and reason, written to a test-prefixed index on the live deployment, with a replayed webhook. No model spend. Test indices deleted afterwards, with an empty listing shown.

**Done when:** the transcript is in the handoff log.

---

### T8.3: The pool reader ★
```yaml
requires:   [T7.1, T8.2]
fixture-ok: yes
size:       M · mid
owns:       internal/pool/
status:     not-started
```
`product_fit` over settled rows only, with T0.12's queries: the denominator, fit returns by direction, feedback by verdict, distinct shoppers by direction, and the seeded split. The status comes from T7.1's rule function, never a second copy of it. The connection stays warm, with a 20 s timeout, so a cold TLS handshake (about 6.9 s in T0.12) never lands on a recommendation. When the index can't be reached, the pool says so and recall carries on without it: it never pretends to an empty pool.

**Done when:** fixture tests reproduce T0.12's 600-purchase numbers exactly. The unreachable index is a distinct, tested outcome. The gate passes.

### T8.3b: The pool reader, live
```yaml
requires:   [T8.3]
fixture-ok: no
size:       XS · mid
owns:       tests/live/pool/
status:     not-started
```
A small seeded population in a test-prefixed index, read back through `product_fit`, with warm and cold latency recorded. No model spend. Test indices deleted afterwards.

**Done when:** the transcript and the latencies are in the handoff log.

---

### T8.4: Corrections that stand on their own ★
```yaml
requires:   [T7.1]
fixture-ok: yes
size:       S · mid
owns:       internal/memory/
status:     in-review
```
A correction with no belief is written as a standing record with no `against`, and never promotes. When a matching belief is later written for the same subject, the standing correction is declared `against` it, once. A correction against an existing belief keeps today's path. The belief is never deleted (developer rule 4).

**Done when:** fixture tests cover a correction before any belief, the belief arriving later, a second matching belief not re-declaring, and today's path unchanged. The gate passes.

**Notes (in-review).** `internal/memory/correction.go` adds the standing path beside the unchanged `RecordCorrection`: `Correction` (words, `domain.Subject`, `domain.ProductLine`, size, event time, `Against`), `Belief` (content, kind, subject, line), `StandingCorrections` with `Record`, `Declare`, `Len` and `Standing`, and `EnsureBeliefDeclaring`, which derives a belief and then declares every matching standing correction against it. `Record` derives the words as a note (`ConceptNote`), so the record has no structural edge, no score and no canonization contribution; `Declare` writes one structural action per correction with the belief in `against` and nothing in `depends_on`, so the belief keeps its standing, dated by the correction's own event time. `Declare` skips every correction that already carries an `Against`, so a second matching belief declares nothing; a later correction is its own journal entry and never revives an earlier declaration; the same words about the same subject, line and size stay one entry, standing or declared. `internal/memory/subject.go` holds the match in one place, `SameSubject`: both sides must name the same subject kind and id, a fit belief must be about a brand and a seller belief about a seller, and the product line compares field by field only where both sides set it, so a side naming no line spans every line of its subject. The size is deliberately not a match key: a correction and a belief naming different sizes are exactly the pair a correction contradicts, so requiring equal sizes would never declare the disagreement. `internal/memory/correction_test.go` covers the correction before any belief, the belief arriving later and declared once, a second matching belief not re-declaring, a later correction not reviving the first, today's path unchanged (three returns, `Out of true` over `Venerable`, three dependents kept), a standing correction declared against an already-earned belief, the match table, and the refusal and repeat cases.

Three things the next agent should not have to rediscover:

- The journal is the caller's per-shopper state, not graph state. `memory.Graph` reads one concept by its exact content (`Inspect`) but cannot enumerate a session's concepts, and a correction's subject, line and size live only in the journal, never in the graph, so a process restart loses the ability to declare. T8.5 owns the per-shopper state that will hold it; rebuilding the journal from a shopper session needs an enumeration and structured fields the seam does not offer. The issue text is in the task report.
- The domain's write table still maps `SignalCorrection` to `record_action`, and that is right for the declared path; `Declare` checks it before every declaration. The standing record does not go through the table at all, because it cites no transaction and no belief and must earn nothing.
- `tests/` and `internal/api/server/` do not call the new path yet. `RecordCorrection` still refuses an unknown belief id, so the served layer keeps today's behaviour until T8.5 wires the standing branch and `EnsureBeliefDeclaring`.

### T8.6: Authenticated callers ★
```yaml
requires:   [T7.1, T7.2]
fixture-ok: yes
size:       M · frontier
owns:       internal/auth/, deploy/edge/
status:     claimed:t86-auth
```
Today the MCP endpoint has no authentication: anyone who reaches the URL can read any shopper's memory by `shopper_id`. product.md ("How it is consumed") requires every caller to be authenticated before anything with real shoppers goes live.

- **Agents:** a key per agent, issued by the seller running the layer, sent as a bearer token. A key is bound to that seller's shoppers; a call for any other `shopper_id` gets the same refusal as an unknown key, so the endpoint can't be used to find out who exists. Keys are stored hashed, can be revoked, and come from the keyring or Render secrets, never a file.
- **Shoppers:** the ledger reads and `set_pooling` act only for the signed-in shopper. For the hackathon, sign-in can be a per-shopper link token issued by the seller (the demo shopper's is a sandbox credential, safe to publish on the judges' page). Record the choice and its limits.
- **Merchant app:** its own key, good only for `product_fit`.
- **Webhooks:** unchanged. Verified PayPal deliveries only, as T2.1 built.

The middleware sits in `internal/auth/` and in front of every route at the edge. The tools' contract doesn't change: auth travels in headers, not in tool arguments.

**Done when:** table tests cover each caller kind with a good key, a wrong key, a revoked key, and a good key asking for another seller's shopper, with the refusals identical where they must be. A test proves no route but `/healthz` and the webhook answers without a key. The gate passes.

---

### T8.5: Recall never refuses ★
```yaml
requires:   [T8.1, T8.3, T8.4, T8.6]
fixture-ok: yes
size:       M · frontier
owns:       internal/api/server/, internal/precedence/, cmd/memento/main.go
status:     not-started
```
Wire the pivot into the served layer. `recall_for_purchase` reads the shopper's session and the pool, and resolves the five-step precedence order as a pure function in `internal/precedence/`: correction, own evidence, pool (adjusted from the usual size), statement, nothing. Every item carries its label. When steps disagree, both come back with the lower one marked overridden. `record_correction` takes the optional belief. `product_fit` and `set_pooling` are served. Thin evidence comes back labelled thin, never as a refusal. Correct the stale "nine frozen tools" comments in `internal/api/server/` and `cmd/memento/main.go`; the surface is eleven.

**Done when:**
- A table test covers every step deciding, every pair of disagreeing steps, and the unreachable pool.
- Today's story test still passes, with the correction first.
- New story tests pass for: a new shopper decided by the pool; a shopper unlike the crowd decided by their own evidence; a standalone correction honoured, then still in force in a later session.
- The gate passes.

### T8.5b: The layer end to end, live ★
```yaml
requires:   [T8.5, T8.1b, T8.2b, T8.3b]
fixture-ok: no
size:       S · frontier
owns:       tests/live/precedence/
status:     not-started
```
The live layer through the hub and a test-prefixed fit index: one shopper per precedence step, plus a correction made in one MCP session and read in a fresh one. Budget: under $0.50. Run one case first and check its cost. Test sessions and indices removed afterwards.

**Done when:** every step decides at least once live, the cross-session correction holds, and the transcript and spend are in the handoff log.
